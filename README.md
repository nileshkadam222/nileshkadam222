I’ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices.
Today, I’m working from home as a software engineer for CRISIL Ltd., and I get to show off all these elements of who I am.

I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus.
After a college education in MCA, and continuing to pursue that hobby, I realized software engineering was the right field for me.

Since then, I’ve worked on countless freelance projects and have been involved with a handful of notable startups.
Today, I’m working as a Software Engineer with the amazing team at CRISIL Ltd, and this year ,I am honoured to receive the CEO award for 2020 in the "Excellence in Technology" from our MD & CEO Ashu Suyash mam.
It came as a pleasant surprise when I heard the amazing news of me receiving the award.

I have done POC's on Email sending Email Notification using AWS ,SMTP servers. Exporting data into Excel and Word documents using Apache POI, ELK Stack/Apache Solr for searching and indexing data.
Uploading Files in AWS S3 Bucket, SharePoint, converting MPP file into Excel.
I’m familiar with a variety of programming frameworks, including Spring Boot, Angular 2+, Java,JavaScript, HTML5 & CSS3 but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire.
I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
